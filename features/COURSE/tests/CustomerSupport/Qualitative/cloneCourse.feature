    Scenario: Verify that Customer Support is able to create course from Qualitative Template
    
       Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
       When I create a course as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name                 | short_name | format | status | product_model_id | is_course_template | owner_id           | course_type | lo_framework_id                      | warn_prebuilt | isbn          | template_version  |

        And I add activities to the content library of "Qualitative Template" template
          | name                                       |

          | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)     |
        
        And I copy course from "Qualitative Template" as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name               | short_name | is_course_template | isbn          | course_term | course_year | status  | course_type | enrollment_start_date | course_end_date   | warn_prebuilt  |
