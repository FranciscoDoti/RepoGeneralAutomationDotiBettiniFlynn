    Scenario: Verify that customer Support is able to create access code for Template

         Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create "Qualitative Template" with the data 
            | field             | value                        |
            | courseType        | Template                     |
            | productModel      | Qualitative                  |
            | courseName        | Qualitative Template         |
            | learningObjective | macmillan calculus           |
            | courseCode        | E2E 301                      |
            | isbnNumber        | 9781464199498                |
            | courseStatus      | draft                        |

        And I activate the "Qualitative Template" template and add the following data
            | field            | value                                                       |
            | courseName       | Qualitative Template                                        |       
            | courseCode       | E2E 301                                                     |
            | templateStatus   | Active On Date                                              |

        And I add the activities in resources to "Qualitative Template" template
            | type                    | activity                                      |

            | addReadingButton        |  Dedication                                   |

        And I click on home button to return to coursepage
        And I copy course from the "Qualitative Template" template with the following data
            | field             | value                        |

            | courseCode        | E2E 301                      |


        And I sign out of Achieve
        And I login to Achieve-CW as "customer_support_1"

        And I generate access code for "Qualitative Template"

        Then I verify that access code is generated

        When I update the access code

        Then I verify that access code is updated
