    Scenario: Verify that Instructor is able to assign the activities in Qualitative course

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create a course as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name                 | short_name | format | status | product_model_id | is_course_template | owner_id           | course_type | lo_framework_id                      | warn_prebuilt | isbn          | template_version  |
            | Qualitative Template | E2E 301    | topics | draft  | 4                | true               | 0050n000002Wt0kAAC | template    | 57ba5934-30c2-4558-b776-b4bef6954d99 | false         | 9781464199490 | 1                 |
        
        And I click on "COURSE TEMPLATES" tab
        And I click on "Qualitative Template" card
        And I click on "Production" Tab

        And I add activities to "Content Library"
            | activities                             |
            | Glossary                               |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored) |

        And I copy course from "Qualitative Template" as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name               | short_name | is_course_template | isbn          | course_term | course_year | status  | course_type | enrollment_start_date | course_end_date   | warn_prebuil |

        And I sign out of Achieve
        And I assign instructor to "Qualitative Course" as a "customer_support_1"
           |   id     |   enrollments         | product_model_id  | course_type    |
           |   id     |   instructor_1        |   4               | course         |
        
        And I login to Achieve-CW as "instructor_1"
     
        And I add the activities in courseplanner to "Qualitative Course" course
            | activity                                                          | 
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                            |                                                        
            | Glossary                                                          |
        And I close the popup message

        And I assign the activities in courseplanner
            | activity                                                         | Points | 
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                           | 5      | 
            | Glossary                                                         | 5      |

        Then I verify that activities are assigned
            | activity                                                         | Status | 
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                           | Open   | 
            | Glossary                                                         | Open   |
        
        Then I see assignments due in the next 7 days on the course Plan tab

        Then I do not see assignments more than 7 days out on the course plan tab
