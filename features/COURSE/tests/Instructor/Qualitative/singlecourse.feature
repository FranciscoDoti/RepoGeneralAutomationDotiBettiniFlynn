        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create a course as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name                 | short_name | format | status | product_model_id | is_course_template | owner_id           | course_type | lo_framework_id                      | warn_prebuilt | isbn          | template_version  |

        And I click on "COURSE TEMPLATES" tab
        And I click on "Qualitative Template" card
        And I click on "Production" Tab

        And I add activities to "Content Library"
            | activities                             |
            | Glossary                               |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored) |

        And I copy course from "Qualitative Template" as "media_producer_2" with the following data
            | name               | short_name | is_course_template | isbn          | course_term | course_year | status  | course_type | enrollment_start_date | course_end_date   | warn_prebuil |

        And I sign out of Achieve
        And I assign instructor to "Qualitative Course" as a "customer_support_1"
            |   id     |   enrollments         | product_model_id  | course_type    |
            |   id     |   instructor_1        |   4               | course         |
        And I login to Achieve-CW as "instructor_1"
            
        And I create a single course from "Qualitative Template" with following data
            | field             | value                        |
            | courseName        | Qualitative Single Course    |
            | courseCode        |  E2E 301                     |

        Then I verify that "Course Created." message is displayed
        And I verify that "Qualitative Single Course" is created
