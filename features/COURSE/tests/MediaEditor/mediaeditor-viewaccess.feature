    Scenario: Verify that Media Editor has only view access that they are not collaborator

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create template with following data 
            | courseType  | productModel       | courseName             | learningObjective                 | courseCode   | isbnNumber     | courseStatus  |

        And I activate the "Quantitative Template" template and add the following data
            | courseName             |  courseCode   |  templateStatus      |
            | Quantitative Template  |   E2E 301     |  Active On Date      | 


        And I add the activities in resources to "Quantitative Template" template
            | type                    | activity                                      |

            | addReadingButton        |  Glossary                                     |

        And I sign out of Achieve

        And I login to Achieve-CW as "media_editor_1"

        Then I verify that media editor has only view access to "Quantitative Template"
