    Scenario: Verify that media producer is able to add collaborator to template and verify that media editor has access to the template

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create "Qualitative Template" with ISBN "9781464199498" 
            | field             | value                        |
            | courseType        | Template                     |
            | productModel      | Qualitative                  |
            | courseName        | Qualitative Template         |
            | learningObjective | macmillan calculus           |
            | courseCode        | E2E 301                      |
            | isbnNumber        | 9781464199498                |
            | courseStatus      | draft                        |

        And I activate the "Qualitative Template" template and add the following data
            | field            | value                                                       |
            | courseName       | Qualitative Template                                       |       
            | courseCode       | E2E 301                                                     |

        And I add the activities in resources to "Qualitative Template" template

            | addReadingButton        |  Dedication                            |

        And I add "media_editor_1" as collaborator to "Qualitative Template"
        And I sign out of Achieve
        And I login to Achieve-CW as "media_editor_1"

        Then I verify that "Qualitative Template" is present and media editor has access to it has collaborator

        And I add the activities in resources to "Qualitative Template" template

            | addReadingButton         | SYMBOLS AND NOTATION                          |

        And I add the following activities to respective folders in resource tab
