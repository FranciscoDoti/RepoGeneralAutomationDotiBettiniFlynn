    Scenario: Verify that Media Producer is able to add folder in courseplanner

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create template with following data 
            | courseType  | productModel      | courseName            | learningObjective      | courseCode   | isbnNumber     | courseStatus  |
            | Template    | Qualitative       | Qualitative Template  | macmillan calculus     | E2E 301      | 9781464199498  | draft         |                      


        And I activate the "Qualitative Template" template and add the following data
            | field            | value                                                       |
            | courseName       | Qualitative Template                                        |       
            | courseCode       | E2E 301                                                     |
            | templateStatus   | Active On Date                                              |

        And I add the activities in resources to "Qualitative Template" template
            | type                     | activity                                      |
            | addButtonAssessment      | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)        |     
            | addButtonLearningcurve   | LC1551301608988                               |
            | addReadingButton         |  Dedication                                   |
            | addButtonReadandpractice | LCRP1550612138614                             |


        And I add the activities in "coursePlanner"
            | activity                                                          | 
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                            |                                                        
            | LC1551301608988                                                   |
            | Dedication                                                        |
            | LCRP1550612138614                                                 |


        And I reorder the resources on template in "COURSE PLAN"
            | actvities                                                         | reorder        |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                            | moveToTop      |                                                     
            | LC1551301608988                                                   | movedownButton |
            | Dedication                                                        | moveToEnd      |
            | LCRP1550612138614                                                 | moveUpButton   |

        Then I verify that resources are reordered in "COURSE PLAN"
            | activities                                                        | orderNumber    |
            | LCRP1550612138614                                                 |  1             |                                                       
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                            |  2             |

        And I add the activities to respective folders in "COURSE PLAN"
            | activity                                      | folders           | message                                                                             |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)        | Assesment         | 'Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)' was successfully moved to Assesment.       |

        And I verify the activities are added in folders which are present in "COURSE PLAN"
            | activity                                      | folders           |

            | LCRP1550612138614                             | ReadandPractice   |

        When I delete the resources from the Template in "COURSE PLAN"
            | folders           | message                                 |
            | Reading           | 'Reading' has been removed.             |

            | ReadandPractice   | 'ReadandPractice' has been removed.     |

        Then I verify that resources are deleted from Template in "COURSE PLAN"
            | folders           |
            | Reading           |
