    Scenario: Verify that Media Producer is able to add activities in folder present in resource tab

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create "Qualitative Template" with the data 
            | field             | value                        |
            | courseType        | Template                     |
            | productModel      | Qualitative                  |
            | courseName        | Qualitative Template         |
            | learningObjective | macmillan calculus           |
            | courseCode        | E2E 301                      |
            | isbnNumber        | 9781464199498                |
            | courseStatus      | draft                        |

        And I activate the "Qualitative Template" template and add the following data
            | field            | value                                                       |

            | courseCode       | E2E 301                                                     |
            | templateStatus   | Active On Date                                              |

        And I add the activities in resources to "Qualitative Template" template
            | type                     | activity                                      |
            | addButtonAssessment      | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)        |     
            | addButtonLearningcurve   | LC1551301608988                               |
            | addReadingButton         |  About The Authors                            |
            | addButtonReadandpractice | LCRP1550612138614                             |

        And I add the following activities to respective folders in resource tab
            | activity                                      | folders           | message                                                                             |

        When I reorder the resources on template
            | folders           | reorder        |
            | Reading           | moveToTop      |
            | Learning Curve    | movedownButton |
            | Assesment         | moveToEnd      |
            | ReadandPractice   | moveUpButton   |

        Then I verify that resources are reordered
            | folders         | orderNumber |
            | ReadandPractice | 1           |
            | Reading         | 2           |

            | Assesment       | 4           |


        And I verify the following activities are present in folders
            | activity                                      | folders           |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)        | Assesment         |

            | LCRP1550612138614                             | ReadandPractice   |

        When I delete the following resources from the Template
            | folders           | message                                 |
