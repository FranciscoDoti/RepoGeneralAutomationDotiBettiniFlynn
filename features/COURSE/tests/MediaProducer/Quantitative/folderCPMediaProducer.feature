    Scenario: Verify that Media Producer is able to add folder in courseplanner

        Given I login to Achieve-CW as "media_producer_2"
        When I create "Quantitative Template" with ISBN "9781464199498" 
            | field             | value                        |
            | courseType        | Template                     |
            | productModel      | Quantitative                 |
            | courseName        | Quantitative Template        |
            | courseCode        | E2E 301                      |
            | learningObjective | Principles of Microeconomics |
            | isbnNumber        | 9781464199498                |
            | courseStatus      | draft                        |

        And I activate the "Quantitative Template" template and add the following data
            | field            | value                                                       |
            | courseName       | Quantitative Template                                       |       
            | courseCode       | E2E 301                                                     |
            | templateStatus   | Active On Date                                              |

        And I add the activities in resources to "Quantitative Template" template
            | type                     | activity                                      |
            | addButtonAssessment      | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)        |     
            | addButtonLearningcurve   | LC1551301608988                               |
            | addReadingButton         |  Dedication                                   |
            | addButtonReadandpractice | LCRP1550612138614                             |


        And I add the activities in "coursePlanner"
            | activity                                                          |

            | LC1551301608988                                                   |
            | Dedication                                                        |

        And I reorder the resources on template in "coursePlanner"
            | actvities                                                         | reorder        |
            | Exercise: Misused words 1 (autoscored)                            | moveToTop      |                                                     
            | LC1551301608988                                                   | movedownButton |
            | Dedication                                                        | moveToEnd      |
            | LCRP1550612138614                                                 | moveUpButton   |

        Then I verify that resources are reordered in "coursePlanner"
            | activities                                                        | orderNumber    |

        And I add the activities to respective folders in "coursePlanner"
            | activity                                      | folders           | message                                                                             |

        And I verify the activities are added in folders which are present in "coursePlanner"
            | activity                                      | folders           |

            | LCRP1550612138614                             | ReadandPractice   |

        When I delete the resources from the Template in "coursePlanner"
            | folders           | message                                 |
            | Reading           | 'Reading' has been removed.             |

        Then I verify that resources are deleted from Template in "coursePlanner"
            | folders           |
            | Reading           |
