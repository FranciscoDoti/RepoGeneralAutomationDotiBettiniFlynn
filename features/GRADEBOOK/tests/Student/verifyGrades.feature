Feature: Verify grade and exception accuracy
  Grades always appear correct under different exceptions and assignment configurations
  These tests rely on there being a course in the Courses tab called "E2E GBK Student Grades Template"
  The course should have the following url assignments available in the Course Plan tab
  Yahoo - https://yahoo.com/
  Wikipedia - https://www.wikipedia.org/
  Google - https://www.google.com/
  Bing - https://www.bing.com/

  Background:
    Given I login to Achieve-CW as "admin_1"
    When I activate course "E2E GBK Student Grades Template" with the following data
      | courseName                    | courseCode |
      | E2E GBK Student Grades Course | E2E 301    |
    And I assign "instructor_gb" to my course
    And I enroll the following students in my course

      | student_gb_1 |
      | student_gb_2 |
      | student_gb_3 |

    And I create a Gradebook Category with dropped lowest grade policy

      | Google    | 10     | student_gb_4 | Drop Lowest Grade | true      |                  |

      | student_gb_4 | 7     | 1   | 3      | test feedback |
    Then I verify grade override modal has correct data
      | student      | originalGrade    | row | column | feedback      |
      | student_gb_4 | 7.00/10.00 pts.  | 1   | 3      | test feedback |
    Then I verify the grades for students

      | student_gb_1 | 2   | 1      | -          |
      | student_gb_1 | 2   | 2      | 0%         |
      | student_gb_1 | 2   | 3      | --         |
      | student_gb_1 | 2   | 5      | --         |
    Then I verify the category total
      | row | column | categoryTotal |
      | 1   | 4      | 80%           |
    Then I verify the course total
      | student      | courseTotal |
      | student_gb_4 | 53%         |
