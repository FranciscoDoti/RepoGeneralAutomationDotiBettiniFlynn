Feature: Creating a new AMS raptor item for different Eval types and simulate grading for each

Scenario Outline: Author creates a <evaltype> type <questionEquation> equation and verifies grading for correct answer <answerEquation> input

  Given I login to AMS
  When I click on the New Raptor item in the AMS page
  And I navigate to AuthorApp tab

  And I select Graded equation and save as <evaltype>
  And I click on the Question tab, and add an Answer field
  And I set the grade as <evaltype> type and input <questionEquation>
  And I save the question

  When I am in Take Mode and input the correct <answerEquation> 
  And I simulate grading
  Then My answer is graded correctly
  Examples:
  | evaltype          | questionEquation      | answerEquation    | 
  | "Relation"        | "2x+26=0"             | "2x+26=0"         |
  | "Expression"      | "x+y"                 | "x+y"             |
  | "Point"           | "(1,4\pi)"            | "(3/3,2*2*Ï€)"     |
