    Given I login to AMS as "all-permissions-author" with "password"

    Scenario: Sorting by ID
        # TestRail Cases: C3126263,C3126281,C3126291, C3126292

        Then I verify the graphs list is "descending" order of graph "Id" column name
        When I click on the "Id" column name
        Then I verify the graphs list is "ascending" order of graph "Id" column name
        When I click on the "Id" column name
        Then I verify the graphs list is "descending" order of graph "Id" column name

    Scenario: Sorting by Title
        # TestRail Cases: C3126288

        # Then I verify the graphs list is "unsorted" order of graph "Title" column name 
        When I click on the "Title" column name
        Then I verify the graphs list is "ascending" order of graph "Title" column name
