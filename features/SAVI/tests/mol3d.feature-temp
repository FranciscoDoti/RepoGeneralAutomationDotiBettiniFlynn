  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> App loads
  Scenario: Mol3d applet loads
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    When I open the mol3d assessment
    Then the mol3d applet loads
    Then I see the correct molecule
    Then I see the mol3d menubar fully

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Rotate X
  Scenario: Rotate the mol3d molecule on the X axis
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the rotate X button
    Then the molecule begins to rotate on the X axis and then all other rotations should cease

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Rotate Y
  Scenario: Rotate the mol3d molecule on the Y axis
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the rotate Y button
    Then the molecule begins to rotate on the Y axis and then all other rotations should cease

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Rotate Z
  Scenario: Rotate the mol3d molecule on the Z axis
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the rotate Z button
    Then the molecule begins to rotate on the Z axis and then all other rotations should cease

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Zoom In
  Scenario: Zoom in on the molecule viewer
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the Zoom in button
    Then the molecule viewer should zoom in on the molecule

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Zoom Out
  Scenario: Zoom out on the molecule viewer
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the Zoom Out button
    Then the molecule viewer should zoom out on the molecule

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Menu Label Atoms Toggle
  Scenario: Toggle on the labels of the atoms
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the Label Atoms button while it was deselected
    Then the atom labels should appear

  Scenario: Toggle off the labels of the atoms
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click the Label Atoms button while it was selected
    Then the atom labels should disappear

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Mouse interaction Rotate molecule
  Scenario: Rotate the molecule within the molecule viewer
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When I click and drag the molecule
    Then the molecule should rotate according to the mouse movement

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Mouse interaction Scroll zoom
  Scenario: Scroll in and out with mouse within the molecule viewer
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When the scrollwheel is scrolled up or down
    Then the molecule viewer should either zoom in or zoom out based on scroll direction

  # SAVI -> Mol3d -> Test Cases -> Google Analytics
  Scenario: Google Analytics events are sent on event
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When an action is performed
    Then a Google Analytics event is sent

  Scenario: Google Analytics uses correct account
    Given I login to IBISCMS as "savicreate"
    Given the mol3d app is loaded
    When a Google Analytics event is sent
    Then the event should be sending to the correct account (Prod -1, QA -3)
